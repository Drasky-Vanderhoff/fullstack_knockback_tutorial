## (Too easy) Introduction 

We are sure you know about this already, but lets do it again just for giving a structure to the tutorial

In a full stack web application what happens is the following:

Assume the user is sitted in front of the computer. 

The user interface that is presented has the nice things that we see (images and generated things by html and css)

But the user's computer sees code (html, css) that is interpreted to show those nice graphics.

But if the application is interactive, there is some script (javascript) code that actually makes that page change nicely and at a speed that the user does not get annoyed and goes away.

But all this data is represented in a ressource model
So we have an [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) or [MVVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) [pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern "design patterns" ) on the client.

And we can go on and say:

But that data came from somewhere (the server), and every time the user writes a post it is sent to the server.
So there must be a communication protocol. 
There are:
    - [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming) "AJAX")
    - [REST](http://www.infoq.com/articles/rest-introduction "A nice article introducing REST architecture")

And so the server defines an API http://www.infoq.com/articles/rest-introduction for REST or AJAX communications

And this data has to be validated, and processed

And stored and given back, 

And the user has to be given only information he can use (and is allowed to see)

Well, there are too many things. 
But we will tacke each of this points
