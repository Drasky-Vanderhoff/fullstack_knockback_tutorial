_Fullstack Knockback Tutorial_
============================


The idea behind this tutorial is:

Help improve documentation on knockback and give a kickstart in using this tool

##Our problems
- Knockback is not just Knockout plus Backbone
- Examples, tutorials and documentation about connecting something with REST is lacking a real example (where data has to be actually validated and models in server are different from the Ressources that people actually see
- Alejandro knows about knockback, Leo has worked for some time on backend and has writen some scientific stuff.
- We are working together on a project, and we need  documentation better suited for us.

##Our goals (Ale and Leo):
- Give a good kickstart in writing knockback applications
- Give a realistic application (a non toy example) that people can use as a base to understand the whole process
- link you to useful resources when needed (and even when not :p)

##What we ask you to do
- If you find an error, please let us know, you can even make a clone and ask later for a pull request. We will be happy to help
- If you don't like something, tell us (be polite), that will help us improve the tutorial
- License is MIT, but if you like it, please link to the tutorial


##What you'll find here
- A generic description of the idea
- A small simplistic tutorial on Web2py (maybe Django will be added later if we have time)
- Some approaches to REST API (from the simplistic one up to a per record and per method user validation)
- The server's source code, maybe more than one copy of it.

- Some approaches in client side, a basic tutorial on starting
- Creating the different parts of the client scripting with coffeescript (and maybe some javascript)
- The client's source code 

- A fully functional application

##What you will NOT find here
- Too many details in the server side code, some things will be boilerplate code and will have a comment on what you should do
- A girlfriend (or boyfriend, or petfriend, or whatever you are on to)
- The ["Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_to_The_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life.2C_the_Universe.2C_and_Everything_.2842.29  "42")




## We am sure many of the ones reading this page will already know about
####Anyways, there are some (dumb) questions that we want to rule out:

1. What are web-apps upto these days?
2. What is a full stack web application?
3. How is a web-app created?
4. Why choosing Python for the server?
5. Why particularly Web2py? my *AWESOME platform here* is better because *Awesome reason*
6. Why scripting on the client side if my *AWESOME platform here* does that on the server?
8. Why Knockback for the clientside and not my *this other AWESOME platform* that is better?
9. Why .... ?

#####And the answers

1. web-apps are getting to give (and need) more and more *interactive* and *real-time* interaction between users
2. We call full stack application one that comprehends the whole needed to actually make it work
3. A web app is created writing code by *awesome people*, that's it. Dhaa! Writing more seriously, we will explain this in more detail later
4. Because Python is **ACTUALLY AWESOME** and we are both Python fan
5. Because Leo knows a little bit about it, it is really easy to get started and over all other reason *It gets the job done* for what we need here. Not satisfied yet? Please write a backend for this app and we will gladly put it in the repo (and give the corresponding credits)
6. Because for *interactive* and *real-time* applications you _absolutenly need_ the client side to do something
8. Because it gets the good things about BackboneJS and KnockoutJS and we like it. You want another platform? Please write a frontend that works with our backend, and we will gladly add it to the repo and will give the corresponding credits
9. Mmm you didn't realize that point 7 was missing
